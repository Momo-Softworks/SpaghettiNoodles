	"description": "This origin is based on a Tree of Life, Elf, or natural elemental playstyle, allowing the player to heal in water with a weakness to fire. This playstyle is best in neutral temperatures due to the weakness applied when hot or cold. Additional strength is applied when the player's temperature is neutral."
