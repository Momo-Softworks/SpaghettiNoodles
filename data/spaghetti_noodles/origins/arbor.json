	"description": "This origin is based on a Tree of Life, Elf, or natural elemental playstyle, allowing the player to heal in water at the added risk of fire. This playstyle is best in neutral temperatures due to the weakness applied when hot or cold. Additional strength is applied when the player's temperature is neutral."
